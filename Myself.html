<center><h1>A Little Something About Me</h1></center>
<p>My Name Is Akinsanya Taiwo. I am a 200 level student of University Of Lagos, Akoka. I was born on the 17th of November, some years back. I'm an Engineering student, Chemical Engineering to be specific.</p>
<p>I hail from Otan Ayegbaju, a great city in Osun State(Land Of The Virtuous), Nigeria. I lived in Osogbo, the State Capital of Osun, before I gained admission. I'm an Anglican member by birth and I choose to be till death.</p>
<p>I'm 5'5 tall, dark in complexion. I love sleeping a lot, and eating, especially Beans and lots of Plantain.</p>
<p>I also love <b>singing</b> a lot, it's like an everyday thing. It helps me relax and let off some steam/stress days make me go through. I play drumset and keyboard as well.
I am a nice and fun person to be with.</p>
